/**
 * The Smartposter Record type is 'Sp'.
 * The smart poster is the type of record that combines multiple records under it.
 * The concept of the smart poster is built around URIï¿½s that are very powerful and can represent the information from unique identifiers to EPC codes to web addresses to SMS messages to phone calls and beyond.
 * The smart poster record defines a structure that associates a URI with several types of metadata such as action, URI type, size of the content the URI refers to, etc.
 * Apart from the specified record types, other records can also be added under the smart poster record.
